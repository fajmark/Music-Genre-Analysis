# Music-Genre-Analysis
This project uses machine learning to classify music genres based on audio features like tempo, vocal presence, rhythm complexity, and instrument detection. It showcases my skills in data analysis, preprocessing, and model development, aimed at building a robust classifier to predict genres from audio data.
